# CarEvaluaitonPrediction-R
Business Intelligence Course Project

Cars are vital in everyday life. It plays an important role as it is a comfortable means of transportations. Every car has a distinct favour in terms of price, feature, safety and the level of luxury it provides. People tend to make clear choices when they decide to buy a car for themselves. They evaluate different cars on various parameters. Manufacturing and business are interested to know the popular features on which buyers make their choice as it can enhance their business value. Data mining algorithms can be employed in this respect. Various data mining algorithms perform differently.

This project aims to understand the decision making process people go through when buying a car and apply it to an entiregroup of models as a classifier from an acceptable car to unacceptable ones. It will also be examined how features affect theprocess. The target feature has four classes and that is why it is a multi-class classification problem.

Accordingly, a categorical attribute was determined as the output varies according to the original data set. For this project, will be using two methods. The first one is the Decision Tree and the second one is Na√Øve Bayes. Also in this research work will compare these two algorithms in terms of the accuracy they offer.
