# CarEvaluaitonPrediction-R
 Business Intelligence Course Project
This project aims to understand the decision making process people go through when buying a car and apply it to an entiregroup of models as a classifier from an acceptable car to unacceptable ones. It will also be examined how features affect theprocess. The target feature has four classes and that is why it is a multi-class classification problem.

Accordingly, a categorical attribute was determined as the output varies according to the original data set. For this project, will be using two methods. The first one is the Decision Tree and the second one is Na√Øve Bayes. Also in this research work will compare these two algorithms in terms of the accuracy they offer.
